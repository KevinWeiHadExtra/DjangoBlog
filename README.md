# DjangoBlog

## Objective

### Make a traditional blog page where I can write blog posts about various topics

###Basic Blog Fucntions:
    - Home index page allows for featured blog posts with basic info and a link to said posts.
    - Each blog's section on the blogs page will contain basic info about said blog, as well as a picture relating to the blog.
    - The ability to sort blog posts by topic in the Blogs page, sorted by publish date by default.
    - Blog Posts themselves will contain a topic, title, short description, author, date published, and body.
    - Blog Posts will also have a section at the bottom where you can leave a comment with a name, upvote or downvote, and a body.
    - Below the comment input section on the Blog posts page will be the comments section where you can see the comments that other people have wrote.
    - The contact page will have a section where you can leave a message with name, email address, phone number, and body.

###More Advanced Blog Functions:
    - Allow for a user login using basicauth that will allow an admin(Me) to login and write blog posts from a designated profile page without having to go into the django admin.
    - Allow for the search functinality in the Navbar where you can search up pages or articles by their title.
